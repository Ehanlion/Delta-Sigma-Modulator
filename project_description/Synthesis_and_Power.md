# Synthesis and Power Analysis

The project includes scripts for Synopsys Design Compiler and PrimeTime.

## Synthesis (`DC_Synthesis.tcl`)
Used to convert the Verilog RTL into a gate-level netlist mapped to the TSMC 16nm standard cell library.

**Key Steps**:
1.  **Setup**: Defines library paths (`N16ADFP_StdCell`).
2.  **Read**: Reads RTL files (currently set to `alu.v` - **needs update to `M216A_TopModule.v`**).
3.  **Constraints**: Defines clock `clk_p_i` (period 8.0ns - **check if 2.0ns is required**), input/output delays.
4.  **Compile**: Optimizes the design.
5.  **Reports**: Generates timing, area, and power reports.
6.  **Output**: Writes `.vg` (netlist), `.sdf` (timing delays), and `.sdc` (constraints).

## Power Analysis (`PrimeTime_PrimePower.tcl`)
Used for accurate power estimation using switching activity from simulation.

**Key Steps**:
1.  **Setup**: similar library setup.
2.  **Read**: Reads the synthesized netlist (`.vg`).
3.  **VCD**: Reads the `.vcd` file generated by the testbench (`read_vcd`).
    - *Note*: You must enable VCD dumping in the testbench (already present: `$dumpfile("M216A_TopModule.vcd")`).
4.  **Analysis**: Reports average or cycle-accurate power.
